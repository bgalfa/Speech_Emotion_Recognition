1. Deep Learning Model for Speech Emotion Recognition using LSTM on the following datasets:
    SAVEE: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/surrey-audiovisual-expressed-emotion-savee"
    TESS: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess"
2. Multiple models are created using the same architecture of the model but varying Activation functions in each and their accuracies are plotted
3. The Highest Test Accuracy was 93.41% achieved on the model using the 'sigmoid' activation function.
